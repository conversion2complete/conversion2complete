- 👋 Hi, I’m @conversion2complete
- 👀 I’m interested in the outdoors, the mountains, kendo, whiskey, wine, beer, foodie of sorts, learning new stuff, and career switch.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... the Data Analysis from freeCodeCamp. If anyone has suggestions else where for learning material in the data science world, please let me know :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... any projects per say. Looking for a few projects to get my feet wet and build a portfolio
- 📫 How to reach me ... 🤷‍♀️
